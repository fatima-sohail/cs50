/*
When making change, odds are you want to minimize the number of coins youâ€™re dispensing for each customer,
lest you run out (or annoy the customer!). Fortunately, computer science has given cashiers everywhere ways
to minimize numbers of coins due: greedy algorithms. if you prompt user to give you a number, output should be
in a way to minimize the num of coins. e.g
If you input -1, does your program prompts you again?
If you input 0, does your program output 0?
If you input 1, does your program output 1 (i.e., one penny)?
If you input 4, does your program output 4 (i.e., four pennies)?
If you input 5, does your program output 1 (i.e., one nickel)?
If you input 24, does your program output 6 (i.e., two dimes and four pennies)?
If you input 25, does your program output 1 (i.e., one quarter)?
If you input 26, does your program output 2 (i.e., one quarter and one penny)?
